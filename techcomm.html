				While Technical Communications was not a class I was originally excited about, it became less of a class about writing and more of a journey about discovering my inner writer and how to mesh with a group. Normally, I am the only female in a project group, almost always for coding. We split up the work and organize a solution, then merge our code and iron out the bugs. In Technical Communications, though, we were forced to work together throughout the whole project. I was in a group of four girls and one boy, and it made the dynamics completely different. Even our topic was different because of this, and we called ourselves the "Cutie Foodies". Together, we wrote a ten page technical game design document for the Apple app we came up with. Because of this project, I am a much better writer and collaborator, and I got a lot of experience working with a diverse group who didn't necessarily share my interests.
