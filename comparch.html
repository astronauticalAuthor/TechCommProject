				Computer Architecture 1 is highly regarded as one of the hardest classes computer science students have to take at my school, and this document is the design document we wrote. In this class we studied in great depth CPU data paths, mostly multicycle ones. The reason why the class was so hard is because we had to design and write the assembly language for our own, completely custom processor. In teams of four, we built a processor completely from scratch using Xilinx and Verilog. The only parts we received were register files, memory, and an inefficient ALU. My group decided to build our own, faster ALU. Together, we designed a multicycle load-store processor, one of the fastest in our class. This project was the blood, sweat, and tears of my sophomore year of college--we worked twenty to twenty-five hour weeks on this, meeting every day, innovating and coming up with new ideas for how to make our current designs better or our incomplete designs finished. We actually reinvented conditional instructions that aren't branches; those are actually a thing in the industry that we came up with separately. Even though this project was ghastly hard, it taught me a lot about team work. We all stayed up together late, got up early, and worked our butts off for this project. It taught me how to love a project and bond with a team, and I think that knowing how to replicate that will really help me in the industry.
