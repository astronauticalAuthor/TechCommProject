				Hello! I'm Katrina Kerrick, a programmer and website designer. I've been programming since the tenth grade, a full five years now! Programming is my major, my hobby, and my passion. I've had many days of exhausting coding, battling a college project, and when I come home to recharge, I code an individual project. Different video games and books come and go, but programming is here to stay.
				<br />
				<br />
				I'm currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology in Terre Haute, Indiana, where I get to work with people who are just as passionate and motivated as I am. I'm loving every day of it!
