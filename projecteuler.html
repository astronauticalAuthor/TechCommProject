				Project Euler is a website made to help budding mathematicians and programmers exercise their programming abilities. There are about five hundred questions posted, ranging in difficulty from extremely simple to graduate level math. Since I was in eleventh grade I've been solving problems on this website. I solve them in my free time, or when I'm bored. They provide an excellent challenge to me and I love the leveling system for completing certain amounts of problems. With this website as a tool, I was able to go from a budding programmer who enjoyed AP Computer Science to skilled enough to score an internship. This website encouragd me to start programming in other languages, to practice the skills I already had, and to research libraries and techniques that I had never even heard of before. It made me the passionate programmer I am today, and I know it will continue to nurture that excitement, that joy in my craft, for the rest of my life.
