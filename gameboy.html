				In Computer Architecture 2, we studied CPU and GPU datapaths and capabilities. Halfway through the class, we had to find project partners so we could write a paper on a topic of our choice. My partner and I had both grown up loving the Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS, so we were extremely excited to study them. Nintendo likes to keep consumers out of their hardware, but they release the full hardware specifications for the naturally curious after no more games are being produced for the product. In this paper, my partner and I got to study the CPU architecture of the GBA and DS, its interesting cache (none at all, surprisingly enough!), its memory, and how it was backwards compatible with previous games. Together, we wrote a research paper that I am greatly proud of. I learned how to do individual research and teach my partner about what I found, while absorbing what he found. We collaborated with our combined knowledge to write the comparison section. While knowing the technical information from this course is important, my writing also greatly improved with the help of a friend who was also invested in the project. I feel like I've become a stronger technical writer because of this.
